Simple Amazon SNS client written in Node.js that will publish to a SPARQL endpoint.  It's designed to be able to convert basic key/value objects from JSON to RDF without any coding.  The configuration file allows you to specify patterns for each SNS topic to create the proper subject, and preface each predicate.

This is a great option to persist messages in RDF rather than writing them to a JSON store.  RDF is preferred over JSON because of the standardized and robust query language that it has, as well as RDF's clarity around typing.
